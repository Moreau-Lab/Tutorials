Intro to Using Git and GitHub
================

## Setting Up GitHub and Git

### Making a GitHub account

Go to github.com and make an account.

### Connecting to the Moreau Lab Organization

Our lab GitHub organization can be found at
<https://github.com/Moreau-Lab>. This is where we keep all of our code,
organized into shared repositories, to enable collaboration and ensure
reproducibility of our research\!

You will need to request to be added to the organization; let Corrie or
Megan know what email is associated with your GitHub account and they
can send you an invitation to join.

### Setting Up Git on Your Computer

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
