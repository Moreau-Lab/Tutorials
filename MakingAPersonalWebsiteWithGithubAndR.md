On your personal [GitHub](github.com), make a new repository that will
correspond to the personal website you are creating. Whatever you name
this repository will show up in the main URL for your website, in the
form “repositoryname.github.io”, so you may want to make it your first
and last name or something like that. Be sure to check the box for
“intialize with a ReadMe”, so that you can easily clone the repository
to your computer.
