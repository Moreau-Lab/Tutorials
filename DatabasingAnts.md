## Databasing the Cornell University Insect Collection Ants

Steps:

1.  Collect your supplies:
      - A sheet of labels with QR codes
      - Scissors
      - Forceps
      - A foam block
2.  Pull out the drawer of ants that you’re working on.
3.  Find the unit tray that you’re working on and pull it out.
4.  Carefully remove the first specimen and pin it to your foam block.
    Take a look at the labels that it bears:
      - If it bears several labels that are hard to read while on the
        pin, carefully remove the labels by pushing the pin into your
        foam block, positioning your forceps above the top-most label,
        and pushing the labels down and off the pin.
          - **Always push with your forceps down and away from the
            specimen, so they can’t slip and damage it**.  
          - Make sure to keep track of the order in which the labels
            were on the pin, so they can be replaced in the same order.

5.  Enter the label data into your databasing spreadsheet.
      - The degree of completeness will vary (drastically) from label to
        label.
